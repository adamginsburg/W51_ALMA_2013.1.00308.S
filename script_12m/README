Cycle: 2 (Early science)
Project code: 2013.1.00308.S
SB name:  w51_a_06_TE
PI name: Adam Ginsburg
Project title: Gas temperature and kinematics as key inputs for star formation theory: Cores and turbulence in the massive protocluster W51
Configuration: 12m array, uid://A002/X9ee74a/X26f0 - compact configuration, uid://A002/Xa8df68/Xb4b - extended configuration

CASA version used for reduction: 4.4.0
Comments from Reducer:

Data reduction & calibration:

For both EBs there were some interferences in amplitude, either from
atmospheric lines or badly calibrated Tsys, falling on the frequency range of
two requested spectral lines, 12CO(2-1) and 13CS(5-4) in SPW 2. 
Channel ranges in EB X26f0: spw=2:188~278;1569~1884,
                in EB Xb4b: spw=2:175~270;1684~1926
These interferences were visible in the phase calibrator. Also the phase
scatter of the phase calibrator is a litte increased for this frequency range.
The affected channels were not flagged, and imaged because they belonged to the
science goal. 
While the images look quite good, some care with the interpretation of the data
might be advisory.

Spw 3 was designated for continuum and PN(5-4) and neither could be imaged:
1) there are locations in the mosaic where there are too many lines to obtain
confidently the continuum emission, 2) the central frequency of spw 3 was
changed due to technical reasons causing the PN(5-4) line to be
outside of the frequency range of spw 3.

Major flagging:

uid://A002/X9ee74a/X26f0:
antenna DV15 flagged due to high Tsys

uid://A002/Xa8df68/Xb4b:
antenna DV12 flagged due to low gain

Not flagged, but might be flagged if found necessary:

uid://A002/Xa8df68/Xb4b:
gains in X and Y polarization slighly offset (distributions are not 
overlapping)for Antenna DV04, spw=2 and Antenna DV24 spw=1
Data was not flagged, because X and Y polarizations will be averaged.

Imaging:

* Requested RMS 5.85 mJy in 0.728 MHz bandwidth at rep. frequency 218.352 GHz -->

Reached, verified on cubes of H2CO 3(0,3)-2(0,2) line in spw 0. 
Cubes of concatenated dataset has an RMS of 4.2 mJy/beam (no cont. subtraction)
or 3.8 mJy/beam (cont. subtraction).
EB X4b4 cube had an RMS of 4.8 mJy/beam (cont. subtraction).

* Continuum RMS calculated by OT: 64.92 micro Jy --> 

Not possible to verify, as mosaic contains positions with many emission lines,
prohibiting extracting confidently only the continuum emission. 


* Requested angular resolution 1.0 arcsec, then changed to 0.2 arcsec --> 

Might be reached when weighting, and using only one EB (Xb4b). 
However for QA2, maps of the concatenated dataset were made.
The two EB had a different angular resolution:
- X26f0 has about 0.8 arcsec ang resolution
- Xb4b has about 0.2 arcsec ang resolution
When the second EB was to be observed, the SG was adjusted from 1.0 arcsec 
to 0.2 arcsec.

Imaging was done on the concatenated data of the two EB, reaching an angular
resolution of 0.55arcsec (beam: 0.51x0.59 arcsec). One map of the high
resolution EB alone was done of the H2CO 3(0,3)-2(0,2) line in spw 0, which had
an angular resolution of 0.29 arcsec (beam 0.31x0.27 arcsec) using natural
weighting and robust=0. Changing the weights might yield a bit higher
resolution.

* Cleaning mode: Continuum subtraction attempted
Attemps of continuum subtraction of the spectral lines were made, but some
remainder of continuum emission is still seen in the line cubes. Also, the
selection of line-free channels was not trivial. Hence, for each cube, imaging
was done both with and without continuum subtraction.

* Clean mask

Images were made without a clean mask, because the emission structure is rather
complex.


* Summary of rms and beamsize of the produced images, based on concatenated
data of the two Execution blocks. RMS in spectral line cubes is the average of
four line free channels. 

Target: w51
Spw 0, line  H2CO 3(0,3)-2(0,2), detected
no continuum subtraction: 4.2 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec
continuum subtraction: 3.8 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec

Spw 1, line C18O(2-1), detected
no continuum subtraction: 3.7 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.68x0.53 arcsec
continuum subtraction: 3.1 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.68x0.53 arcsec

Spw 2, line 12CO(2-1), detected
no continuum subtraction: 5.0 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec
continuum subtraction:  4.5 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec
Spw 2, 13CS(5-4), detected
no continuum subtraction: 4.5 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec
continuum subtraction:  3.8 mJy/beam, beamsize 0.59x0.51 arcsec

Spw 3 was designated for continuum and PN(5-4) and neither could be imaged:
1) there are locations in the mosaic where there are too many lines to obtain
confidently the continuum emission, 
2) the central frequency of spw 3 was changed for technical reasons causing the
PN(5-4) line to be outside of the frequency range of spw 3.

This file describes the content of the tar file you have received. The
full data structure is inserted below.

At this stage, we are releasing data after completion of one SB (excuted
multiple times if required), so you will find only one member_ouss_id
directory.  This directory contains this README file and the following
directories:calibration, script, qa2, log, product.

- 'calibration' contains the files needed for calibration starting from
the initial ms to the fully calibrated data. 
- 'script' contains the reduction scripts used to process the initial ms
to calibrated data, but also to obtain concatenated data (if more than
one execution) and imaging products.  There are usually several scripts
dealing with different parts of the processing.
In case the calibration was done by the automated pipeline, you will
also see the Pipeline Processing Request File (PPR).
The most important script for you is the "scriptForPI.py". See the
section "How to obtain a calibrated MeasurementSet (MS) for your data?"
further below. 
- 'product' contains the fits files of the selected image products. 
These will not include all images of scientific value, but will indicate
the quality of the calibration and images.
- 'qa' contains the qa2 reports that show plots and text information
needed to assess the quality of the processing.  The resultant image
rms, compared with that proposed, is given. In case the calibration was 
done by the automated pipeline, you will find the pipeline Weblog here.
- 'log' contains the CASA log files. 

For more information see also the "ALMA QA2 Data Products" document
which is available for download from the ALMA Science Portal at 
http://almascience.org/documents-and-tools/cycle-2/alma-qa2-products-v2.1 
and the ALMA Knowledgebase article on the QA2 pass/fail criteria at
https://help.almascience.org/index.php?/XX/Knowledgebase/Article/View/285 
(where the XX is to be replaced by ea, eu, or na depending on your location).

Primary beam correction

The images included in this delivery are corrected for the primary beam (PB),
i.e. the dependence of the instruments sensitivity on direction within the FOV.

For each image, two files are being delivered:
  a) the  PB-corrected image (file name ending in ".pbcor.fits")
  b) the image of the PB which was used in the correction (ending in ".flux.fits")
The image noise was measured in the uncorrected image.
The corrected image (a) was then obtained by dividing the uncorrected image by
the PB image (b).
The uncorrected image can be recovered using the CASA task impbcor in mode "m":
impbcor(imagename='image.pbcor.fits', pbimage='image.flux.fits', mode='m', 
        outfile='image.recovered')

How to obtain a calibrated MeasurementSet (MS) for your data?

In case you want to re-reduce your data yourself, you will need to
obtain the raw data in ASDM format from the request handler or
other server where it is staged for you (see your notification 
email).

If you downloaded and untarred all available files for this delivery
as described in the notification email, then you will already see
(in addition to the directories shown in the tree listing above)
a directory "raw" containing your raw data in subdirectories
named "uid*.asdm.sdm" and no further action is necessary.

If you do not have a raw directory, yet, you will need to download
and untar the tar balls of the raw data belonging to this delivery
and make sure they are put into the "raw" directory in your
"member_ouss_..." directory.

Once the raw data is in place, cd into directory "script", start
 
   casapy --pipeline

and type

   execfile('scriptForPI.py')

(If you have not installed the CASA version with the ALMA pipeline
included, the "--pipeline" switch is not available.
Check in the "script" directory of your delivery package to see
if it contains a file named "PPR*.xml".
If there is no such file, you will be able to run the calibration
without the pipeline. Otherwise, you will have to install
the CASA version with pipeline.)

For more information on the execution of the pipeline please refer to
the ALMA Pipeline Quickstart Guide available at
http://almascience.org/documents-and-tools/cycle-2/alma-pipeline-quickstart-guide

Running the scriptForPI will execute the entire calibration procedure 
and result in an MS or a set of MSs ready for imaging. 

In case the data was processed using the automated pipeline,
scriptForPI.py will produce the calibrated MS(s) by running the
"casa_piperestorescript" which applies the packaged calibration
and flagging tables (rather then regenerating them).

The calibrated MS(s) can then be processed with "scriptForImaging.py".

The "scriptForImaging.py" may partially be interactive (for masking)
and should be executed by copy and paste.

The scriptForPI offers a "SPACESAVING" option to limit the disk space 
usage during and after its execution. In order to make use of this, 
the Python global variable SPACESAVING needs to be set before starting 
the script, e.g. using

  SPACESAVING = N
  execfile('scriptForPI.py')

where N is an integer from 0 to 3 with the following meaning:
SPACESAVING = 0 same as not set (all intermediate MSs are kept)
            = 1 do not keep intermediate MSs named *.ms.split
            = 2 do not keep intermediate MSs named *.ms and *.ms.split
            = 3 do not keep intermediate MSs named *.ms, *.ms.split,
                and *.ms.split.cal (if possible)

With SPACESAVING=0, the required additional diskspace is up to 14 times 
as large as the delivered data (products and rawdata) while with 
SPACESAVING=3 (maximum savings), it is up to 6 times as large. 
The script will estimate the required disk space and will not execute 
if there is not sufficient free space available.

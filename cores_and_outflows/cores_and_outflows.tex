\title{Cores and Outflows and Chemistry in the W51 Protoclusters}

This is not yet a paper.  It is a collection of paper ideas and some 
preliminary analysis that will make it in to one or more papers.

Data summary: the 7m and 12m data have all been delivered, but the UV coverage
is non-optimal.  Importantly and unfortunately, no single-dish (total power)
data were ever acquired.  I have requested APEX observations using the new
PI230 instrument to recover the spectral line zero spacings, but that data may
not be received for quite some time.  The original proposed project connecting
cloud scales to core scales will not be possible until the single dish data are
acquired.


Subprojects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Core identification and mass estimation and maybe even
        core mass function constraints.  Lead: Ginsburg.  This document
        is a quasi-draft of that work.
    \item ``A multi-phase outflow from a high-mass protostar"
        The Lacy jet is detected in both CO and RRLs.  This tells us something
        about its proximity to the HII region IRS2, but what else can we learn
        from it?  Lead: maybe Ginsburg.  Maybe this gets incorporated
        into other papers.
    \item Comparitive chemistry of the W51 cores.  Lead: Victor Rivilla \&
        Maite Beltr{\'a}n, possibly with participation from Alvaro
        Sanchez-Monge.
        This project will involve identifying all of the lines in the W51 cores
        and examining how the chemistry relates to physical parameters.
        We will use LTE modeling tools (XCLASS, MADCUBA) for many species to
        identify lines and determine abunances and temperatures
    \item \formaldehyde and CO turbulent cloud modeling / simulation comparison
        (Loughnane).  A difficulty here is that combination of the 7m and 12m
        data has not worked out very well yet, either for the lines or the
        continuum, and that may render cloud-scale analysis quite difficult.
    \item A study of the CO outflows.  Lead: Maybe Luke Maud?  Ciriaco Goddi
        will be involved.  The $^{12}$CO and SO outflows are spectacular and
        plentiful.  It is not obvious whether they can or should be
        incorporated into this paper; at least, I am not presently prepared to
        put in the effort to quantify the outflows properly.  Ciriaco is PI of
        a long-baseline program that has resolved the e2/e8 and North cores
        with $5\times$ better resolution than this program, and that data set
        may therefore be better suited to a core-outflow association work.
    \item Relative kinematics of ionized and molecular gas.  Lead: Galv{\'a}n-Madrid.
        Kinematics similar to \citet{Keto2008a} using RRLs+molecular lines to determine
        outflow vs infall

\section{Overview}
\todo{This section is not part of any proposed paper text.}
The work below will be incorporated into one or more papers as it proves useful.
The figures \& text represent an initial exploration of the data.  There are some important notes
that are not included in the text:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The data reduction has some substantial problems because of strange UV coverage
        and stranger behavior of clean (for which I have opened many tickets).  It appears
        impossible to get the noise below $\sim1 $ mJy around the bright sources, and detections
        are unreliable below $\sim10$ mJy in these area (which I've tried to account for when doing
        source extraction)
    \item The 7m data does not combine well with the 12m data.  It seems to
        cause major large-angular-scale artifacts.  I think this is a weighting
        issue in which the 7m data have lower noise than the 12m data and are
        therefore too heavily weighted, causing large "halos" where the large
        angular scale dominates over the small, providing spuriously strong
        detections.  In principle, this can be solved by downweighting the 7m data,
        but it turns out CASA does not have that implemented (\texttt{innertaper}
        is the relevant keyword)

\end{itemize}


\section{Observations}
As part of ALMA Cycle 2 program 2013.1.00308.S, we observed a
$\sim2\arcmin\times1\arcmin$ region centered between W51 IRS2 and W51 e1/e2
with a 37-pointing mosaic.  Two configurations of the 12m array were used,
achieving a resolution of 0.2\arcsec.  Additionally, a 12-pointing mosaic was
performed using the 7m array, probing scales up to XXX\arcsec.  The full UV
coverage was from XX to YY m.

Data reduction was performed using CASA.  The QA2-produced data products were
combined using the standard inverse variance weighting (check this).
The visibilities were imaged into full spectral cubes at coarse (0.5\arcsec)
resolution in order to get a first look at all 15630 spectral channels.  The
resulting cube was used to identify bright lines in the spectrum extracted
from source e8.  To produce continuum images, frequency channels including
bright lines were excluded.

The spectral setups were ...

\subsection{Data Reduction}
\subsubsection{Continuum}
A continuum image combining all 4 spectral windows was produced using
\texttt{tclean}.  We phase self-calibrated the image on baselines longer than
100m to increase the dynamic range.  The final image was cleaned with 50000
iterations to a threshold of 5 mJy.  The lowest noise level in the image, away
from bright sources, is $\sim0.2$ mJy/beam, but near the bright sources e2 and
IRS2, the noise reached as high as $\sim2$ mJy/beam.  Deeper cleaning was
attempted, but lead to instabilities.


\subsubsection{Lines}
We produced spectral image cubes of the lines listed in Table ....
The cubes use only 12m data, as the 12m + 7m combination was unsuccessful.


\subsubsection{UV coverage}

\subsection{Morphological Analysis}
\label{sec:morphology}
The largest detected structures include the W51 Main HII region bubble and the
W51 IRS2 HII region, which are relatively uninteresting since their properties
have been previously well-characterized using radio (JVLA) data.  More exciting
are the bright dusty structures, especially the ``tail'' pointing south of W51
e8, which can be described as a 0.25 pc by 0.05 pc filament. This structure has
a very high surface brightness along its ridge, exceeding 40 mJy/beam in our TE
maps (23 K or 3.7\ee{4} MJy sr$^{-1}$).  This high brightness implies a high
intrinsic temperature, $T>30$ K (Section \ref{sec:temperature}).

This narrow filament is most prominent in the continuum. It is evident
in some lines (\formaldehyde, $^{13}$CS, \ceighteeno), but not others (SO, ).
It is surrounded by molecular emission that is only slightly fainter...
...in SO it's pretty uniform brightness...

\subsubsection{A bubble around e5}
There is evidence of a bubble in the continuum around e5 with a radius of
6.2\arcsec (0.16 pc; Figure \ref{fig:e5bubble}).  The bubble is completely
absent in the centimeter continuum, so the observed emission is from dust.  The
bubble edge can be seen from 58 \kms to 63 \kms in \ceighteeno and
\formaldehyde, though it is not continuous in any single velocity channel.
There is a collection of compact sources (protostars or cores) along the
southeast edge of the bubble.

The presence of such a bubble in dense gas, but its absence in ionizing gas, is
surprising.  The most likely mechanism for blowing such a bubble is ionizing
radiative feedback, especially around a source that is currently a hypercompact
HII region, but since no free-free emission is evident within or on the edge of
the bubble, it is at least not presently driving the bubble.  A plausible
explanation for this discrepancy is that e5 was an exposed O-star within the
past Myr, but has since begun accreting heavily and therefore had its HII
region shrunk.  This model is marginally supported by the presence of a `pillar'
of dense material pointing from e5 toward the south.

\FigureTwo{figures/e5_bubble.png}{figures/e5_bubble_robust2.png}
{The bubble around source e5.  The bubble interior shows no sign of centimeter
emission, though the lower-left region of the shell - just south of the
``cores'' - coincides with part of the W51 Main ionized shell.  The source of
the ionization is not obvious.
({\it Left}): A robust -2.0 image with a small (0.2\arcsec) beam and poor
recovery of large angular scale emission.  This image highlights the presence
of protostellar cores on the left edge of the bubble and along a filament just
south of the central source.
({\it Right}): A robust +2.0 image with a larger (0.4\arcsec) beam and better
recovery of large angular scales.  The contours show radio continuum (14.5 GHz)
emission at 1.5, 3, and 6 mJy/beam.  While some of the detected 1.4 mm emission
in the south could be free-free emission, the eastern and northern parts of the
shell show no emission down to the 50 $\mu$Jy noise level of the Ku-band map,
confirming that they consist only of dust emission.
}{fig:e5bubble}{1}{8cm}




\subsection{Kinematics}
\label{sec:kinematics}
We examine the gas kinematics throughout the cloud, but especially near the 
massive cores.

The ambient cloud, which consists of gas that has not yet condensed into
compact prestellar objects, is evident in absorption against the mm cores at
55-58 \kms (toward e2) and 57-60 \kms (toward e8).  Narrower velocity
components related to the known high-velocity streams are detected around 68
\kms toward both sources.  These absorption features are seen in all 
\formaldehyde transitions, CH3OH422-312, OCS18-17,
but it was less obvious or absent in HNCO1011 in OCS19-18

In the material surrounding the e2 and e8 ``cores'', one particularly notable
feature is that the cores themselves show a redshifted centroid velocity
relative to their surroundings in nearly all of the bright lines (H2CO, OCS,
SO, \ceighteeno).  The observed shift is up to $\lesssim2$ \kms.  The shift is
a sign of infall.  Given the high continuum brightness, the cores are likely
optically thick in the continuum (Section \ref{sec:} XXX), therefore obscuring
all molecular emission behind them.  We are seeing only gas in the
foreground, and this gas is clearly moving toward the cores.

The source ALMAmm14 shows a similar kinematic signature....

\subsection{Simulations}
{\bf Unfortunately CASA's simulations produce reproducible incorrectness, in
that I cannot get an image that matches the input image.  There seems to
*always* be some flux scaling no matter what input unit is used.  Therefore, I
don't trust any of the results of CASA simulations yet.  Perseus looks OK, but
Aquila is just flat out wrong, and the scale-recovery simulations I attempted
also failed.

Followup on the above paragraph: I've gotten the simulations worked out; CASA
always treats data as if they are in Jy/beam even if Jy/pixel units are
specified when using the \texttt{sm.predict} module.  However, I'm not
convinced of their utility at this stage.}

The enhanced noise around bright sources is unavoidable.  We tested the noise
properties of our data set using the CASA \texttt{simobserve} toolkit.  We
obtained a Herschel Gould's Belt Survey image of the Perseus molecular cloud at
250 \um \citep[resolution 18\arcsec][]{} and scaled it down by $\sim40\times$
to match the resolution of our ALMA data.  We used the \texttt{sm.predict} task
to ``observe'' the Herschel data with our exact UV data set.  We then used
\texttt{sm.corrupt} to make the noise properties approximately match those of
our observations.

We used the Perseus data scaled from 250 \um to 1.3 mm assuming
a relatively shallow $\beta=1.5$ and a constant temperature $T=20$ K
(since temperature maps are not available).
For the Aquila data, we used the column density and temperature maps to
derive a synthetic 1.3 mm map assuming an opacity $\kappa_{505 \mathrm{GHz}} =
4$ g \percc.  Since Aquila is at a greater distance, the Herschel resolution is
coarser (0.9 \arcsec at 5.4 kpc) than our best resolution of 0.2\arcsec, so it
is best compared to lower-resolution tapered data.


When imaging the Perseus data set, we put NGC 1333 at the image center.  At the
noise levels in our data, only the central portions of NGC 1333 are detected,
with three point sources recovered.  In this map, the noise properties are
very uniform.  We are therefore unable to analyze the NGC
1333 data with the exact same parameters as were used on W51.  However, using
similar parameters (but with a lower significance threshold), we detect only
three sources.

In a second experiment, we scaled the peak flux density of the Perseus map to
be $\sim100\times$ brighter than it should be, making it comparable to the flux
density of W51e2 in the real ALMA observations.  In this map, even with deep
cleaning, the noise around the bright sources remains very high and artifacts
are evident.



\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Source Identification}
% dendrogramming.py
We used the \texttt{dendrogram} method described by \citet{Rosolowsky2008a} and
implemented in \texttt{astrodendro} to identify sources.  We used a minimum
value of 1 mJy/beam ($\sim5-\sigma$) and a minimum $\Delta=0.4$ mJy/beam
($\sim2-\sigma$) with minimum 10 pixels (each pixel is 0.05\arcsec).  This
cataloging yielded over 8000 candidate sources, of which the majority are noise
or artifacts around the brightest sources.  To filter out these bad sources,
we created a noise map taking the local RMS of the \texttt{tclean}-produced
residual map over a $\sigma=30$ pixel (1.5\arcsec) gaussian.  We then removed
all sources with peak S/N < 8, mean S/N per pixel $< 5$, and minimum S/N per
pixel $ < 1$.  We also only included the smallest sources in the dendrogram,
the ``leaves''.  These parameters were tuned by checking against ``real''
sources identified by eye and selected using \texttt{ds9}: most real sources are
recovered (but not all; see Section ...) and few spurious sources ($<10$) are
included.  The resulting catalog includes 113 sources.

The `by-eye' core extraction approach, in which we placed ds9 regions on all
sources that look `real', produced a more reliable but less complete (and less
quantifiable) catalog.  This catalog is more useful in the regions around the
bright sources e2 and north, since these regions are affected by substantial
uncleaned PSF sidelobe artifacts.  In particular, the dendrogram catalog includes
a number of sources around e2/e8 that, by eye, appear to be parts of continuous
extended emission rather than local peaks; ``streaking'' artifacts in the
reduced data result in their identification despite our threshold criteria.

\subsection{The spatial distribution of cores}
The detected cores are not uniformly distributed across the observed region.
The most notable feature in the spatial distribution is their alignment: most
of the cores are detected along common lines.  This is especially evident
in W51 IRS2, where the core density is very high and there is virtually no
deviation from the line.  The e8 filament is also notably linear, though there
area few sources detected just off the filament. 

On a larger scale, the e8 filament points toward e2, apparently tracing a
slightly longer filamentary structure.  With some imagination, this might be
extended along the entire northeast ridge to eventually connect in a broad
half-circle with the IRS2 filament (Figure \ref{fig:corepositions}).  This
morphology hints at a possible sequential star formation event, where some
central bubble has swept gas into these filaments.  However, this ring has no
counterparts in ionized gas, and there is little reason to expect such circular
symmetry from a real cloud, so the star forming circle may be merely a figment.

Whether it is physical or not, there is a notable lack of cores within the
circle.  There is no lack of molecular gas, however, as both CO and \formaldehyde
emission fill the full field of view.

}{fig:corepositions}{1}{16cm}

\subsection{Photometry}
We created a catalog of the dendrogram sources including their peak and mean
flux density, their centroid, and their geometric properties.  For each source,
we further extracted aperture photometry around the centroid in 6 apertures:
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5\arcsec.  We performed the same aperture
photometry on the W51 Ku-band images from \citet{Ginsburg2016a}.  These
observations are reported in Table {...}.

The source flux density distribution is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fluxhistograms}.  The most common nearest-neighbor separation between
cataloged cores is $\sim0.3\arcsec$, which implies that the larger apertures
double-count some pixels.  The smallest separation is
0.26\arcsec, so the 0.2\arcsec aperture contains only unique pixels.

{fig:dendrofluxhistograms}
{1}{16cm}

\subsubsection{Distribution Functions}
We fit power law distributions to each aperture's flux distribution.  The
powerlaws steepen slightly from $\alpha=2.0\pm0.12$ to $\alpha=2.2\pm0.16$ for
larger apertures.  The minimum flux represented by a power law increases from
$\sim20$ mJy to 0.4 Jy (14-280 \msun at 20K).  These slopes are shallower than 
the Salpeter-like slope for the mass function derived by \citep{Konyves2015a}
for their sample, though with only modest significance ($<3-\sigma$).  Of
course, these measurements are of the continuum flux density, not directly of
the mass, and so a direct comparison may not be appropriate.  We revisit this
question after assessing the dust temperature in Section \ref{sec:temperature}.

\subsection{Spectral Lines \& Velocities}
To determine the line-of-sight velocity of each source, we extracted a spectrum
from an 0.5\arcsec aperture centered on the source and from a 0.5-1.0\arcsec
annulus around it.  We then searched each spectrum for the brightest pixel and
associated it with the likeliest spectral line.  We repeated this in each of
our 4 spectral windows, then averaged the 4 velocities to get an estimate of
the source velocity.   This process also allowed us to identify the brightest
lines in each window and the brightest overall line observed, which we use
later for temperature estimation.

\subsection{Temperature Estimation}
\label{sec:temperature}
The temperature is a critical ingredient for determining the total mass of each
continuum source or region. Since we do not have any means of directly
determining the dust temperature, as the SED peak is well into the THz regime
and inaccessible with any existing instruments at the requisite resolution, we
employ alternative indicators.  Above a density $n\gtrsim10^5-10^6$ \percc,
the gas and dust become strongly collisionally coupled, meaning the gas
temperature should accurately reflect the dust temperature.  Below this density,
the two may be decoupled.

The average dust temperature, as estimated from Herschel Hi-Gal SED fits
\citep{Molinari2016a,Wang2015a}, is 38 K when including the 70 \um data or 26 K
when excluding it.  This average is obtained over a $\sim45\arcsec$ ($\sim 1$
pc) beam and therefore is likely to be strongly biased toward the hottest dust
in the HII regions and around the massive cores, which are known to have
temperatures reaching $>300$ K \citep{Goddi2016a}.  Despite these
uncertainties, this bulk measurement provides us with a reasonable range to
assume for the uncoupled, low-density dust, which (weakly) dominates the mass
(see Section \ref{sec:massbudget}).

One constraint on the dust temperature we can employ is the absolute surface
brightness.  For some regions, especially the ``filament'' and the hot cores
noted in Section \ref{sec:morphology}, the surface brightness is substantially
brighter than is possible for a beam-filling, optically thick blackbody at 20
K, providing a lower limit on the dust temperature ranging from 30 K (40
mJy/beam) to 600 K (1 Jy/beam).  Toward most of this emission, optically-thick
free-free emission can be strongly ruled out as the driving mechanism using
existing data that limits the free-free contribution to be $<50\%$ if it is
optically thick, and negligible ($<<1\%$) if it is optically thin (Ginsburg et
al, 2016; Goddi2016a).

To gain a more detailed measurement of the dust temperature in regions where it
is likely to be coupled to the gas, we use the peak brightness temperature
$T_{B,max}$ of lines along the line of sight.  If the observed molecule is in
local thermal equilibrium, as is expected if the density is high enough to be
coupled to the dust for many molecules, and it is optically thick, the
brightness temperature provides an approximate measurement of the true physical
temperature near the $\tau=1$ surface.  If any of these assumptions do not
hold, $T_{B,max}$ will set a lower limit on the true gas temperature.  Only
nonthermal maser emission would push $T_{B,max} > T_{gas}$.

One potential problem with this approach is if the gas becomes optically thick
before probing most of the dust.  Some transitions, e.g. CO and \formaldehyde, 
are likely to be affected by this issue.

continuum matches that of the lines; technically this means that it should be
impossible for any point to be below the line.  
%However, in this
%iteration of the plot, the lines are extracted from broader apertures than the
%continuum, so the continuum peak brightness is capable of being higher than the
%line peak brightness.  TODO: replace this plot once spectra have been
%appropriately extracted from the high-resolution spectral data cube.

\subsection{The most massive protostellar cores in W51}
In Figure \ref{fig:hmradprof}, we show the radial profiles extracted from the
three high-mass protostellar cores in W51: W51 North, W51 e2e, and W51 e8.
The plot shows the enclosed mass out to $\sim1\arcsec$ (5400 AU).  On larger
spatial scales, the enclosed mass rises more shallowly, indicating the end of the
core (though our data are capable of recovering spatial scales up to XXXXX).

All three sources show similar radial profiles, containing up to 3000 \msun
within a very compact radius of 5400 AU (0.03 pc).  However, the temperature
structure within these sources is certainly not homogeneous, and very likely a
large fraction of the total flux comes from $T\gtrsim300$ K heated material
\citep[Section \ref{sec:temperature}][]{Goddi2016a}.  If the observed dust were
all at 600 K, the mass would be $\sim17\times$ lower, 100 \msun, which we treat
as a strict lower bound as it is unlikely that the dust more than $\gtrsim1000$
au is so warm.  Additionally, it is very likely that a substantial mass of cold
dust is also present but undetectable because it is hidden by the hotter dust.

\Figure{figures/cumulative_radial_flux_massivecores.png}
{The cumulative flux density radial profiles centered on three
massive protostellar cores.  They share similar profiles and
are likely dominated by hot dust in their innermost regions,
but they are more likely to be dominated by cooler dust in their
outer, more massive regions.}
{fig:hmradprof}{1}{14cm}

\subsection{The most massive prestellar cores in W51}
% may be repeated from temperature section above
To place limits on the most massive prestellar cores, we need to know the
temperature of the dust in all of the bright ($>15$ mJy; 10 \msun at 20 K)
sources.  We do not have any direct means of evaluating the dust temperature,
but we can infer at
least a lower limit on it by determining the peak brightness temperature of an
optically thick line that is excited at densities $n\gtrsim10^5$ \percc, at
which the dust and gas are coupled.

To accomplish this, we have found the brightest lines across the full $\sim6
GHz$ spectra and measured their peak brightness temperature.

\todo{TODO: use coarser resolution (2\arcsec = 0.1 pc?) data to extract ``cores''
where no smaller (protostellar) cores are detected.  Try to estimate their masses.
These are the best candidate ``prestellar" cores, though likely anything this
large is likely to be a massive cluster...}

\subsection{The mass budget on different spatial scales}
\label{sec:massbudget}
An important evolutionary indicator is the amount of mass at a given density; a
more evolved (more efficiently star-forming) region will have more mass at high
densities.  We cannot measure the dense gas fraction directly, but the amount of
flux density recovered by an interferometer provides a reasonable approximation.

% total_mass_analysis
For the ``total'' flux density in the region, we use the Bolocam Galactic Plane
Survey observations \citep{Aguirre2011a,Ginsburg2013a}, which are the closest
in frequency single-dish millimeter data available.  We assume a spectral index
$\alpha=3.5$ to convert the BGPS flux density measurements at 271.4 GHz to the
mean ALMA frequency of 226.6 GHz.  The ALMA data (\todo{specifically, the
0.2\arcsec 12m-only data}) have a total flux 23.2 Jy above a very conservative
threshold of 10 mJy/beam in our
mosaic; in the same area the BGPS data have a flux of 144 Jy, which scales down to
76.5 Jy.  The recovery fraction is 30$\pm3$\%, where the error bar accounts
for a change in $\alpha\pm0.5$.  The threshold of 10 mJy/beam corresponds to
a column threshold $N>10^{25}$ \percc for 20 K dust.  For an unresolved spherical source,
this corresponds to a volume density $n>10^{8.1}$ \percc.

\todo{TODO: determine the largest angular scale in the ALMA images.  Requires
using the simulations.}

\subsection{Chemically Distinct Regions}
The ``hot cores'' in W51 are resolved and multi-layered.

Surrounding W51e2e, we noted the presence of sharp-edged uniform-brightness
regions in a few spectral lines over the range 51-60 \kms (Figure
\ref{fig:chemmapse2}).  These features are elongated in the direction of the
outflow, but have significant extend orthogonal to the outflow, spanning
$9500\times6600$ AU.  They are prominent in \methanol, OCS, and \dimethylether, weak
but present in \formaldehyde and SO, and absent in \cyanoacetylene and HNCO.

Around e8, a similar feature is observed, but this time \dimethylether is absent.

Along the south end of the e8 filament, no such enhanced features are seen; only
\formaldehyde and the lowest transition of \methanol are evident.

Toward W51 north, \methanol, \formaldehyde, and SO exhibit the sharp-edged enhancement feature,
while the other species do not.  The enhancement is from 50-60 \kms.

Given the enhanced abundance of \methanol in particular, it seems likely that these
sharp-edged bubbles represent sublimation zones in which substantial quantities
of grain-processed materials are released into the gas phase.  The sharp edges
likely reflect the particular point where the temperature exceeds the sublimation
temperature for each species.

The relative chemical structures of e2, e8, and IRS2 are relatively similar.
The same species are detected in all of the central cores.  However, in e2,
\dimethylether, \methylformate, \ethylcyanide, and Acetone (\acetone) are
significantly more extended in e2 than in the other sources.
\gaucheethanol is detected in W51 North, but is weak in e8 and almost absent
in e2.

The substructure of different species in e2 is also revealing.  Species that
are elongated in the NW/SE direction are associated primarily with the outflow
(\cyanoacetylene, \ethylcyanide).  Other species are associated primarily with
the extended core (\methylformate, \dimethylether, \acetone).  Some are only
seen in the compact core (\methyleneamidogen, HNCO, \formamide, and
vibrationally excited \cyanoacetylene).  Only \methanol and OCS are associated
with both the extended core and the outflow, but not the greater extended
emission.  \ketene seems to be associated with only the extended core, but not
the compact core. Finally, there are the species that trace the broader ISM in
addition to the cores and outflows (\formaldehyde, $^{13}$CS, OCS, C$^{18}$O
and SO).  Both HCOOH and N$_2$D+ are weak and associated only with the innermost

{Moment 0 maps of the e2 region in 40 different lines over the range 51 to 60
\kms with continuum subtraction using the 30th percentile emission
over the ranges 25-40 and 75-90 \kms.  All images are on the same scale, and
the negative features show absorption against the continuum.  There
is a strong `halo' of emission seen in the CH$_3$Ox lines and OCS.  Extended
emission is also clearly seen in SO, $^{13}$CS, and \formaldehyde, though these
lines more smoothly blend into their surroundings.  HNCO and \formamide have
smaller but substantial regions of enhancement with a sharp contrast to their
surroundings.  HC$_3$N traces the e2 outflow.  The bright H30$\alpha$ emission
marks the position of e2w, the hypercompact HII region that dominates the
centimeter emission in e2.

{Moment 0 maps of the e8 region in 40 different lines over the range 52 to 63
\kms with continuum subtraction using the 30th percentile emission
over the ranges 25-40 and 75-90 \kms.  All images are on the same scale, and
the negative features show absorption against the continuum.  As in e2,
there is extended emission in the CH$_3$OH and OCS lines, but in contrast,
the othe CH$_3$Ox lines are more compact. SO is brighter than OCS in e8, 
whereas the opposite is true in e2.

\kms with continuum subtraction using the 30th percentile emission
over the ranges 25-40 and 75-90 \kms.  All images are on the same scale, and
the negative features show absorption against the continuum.  Qualitatively,
 the relative extents of species seem comparable to e8.  The H30$\alpha$ 
 point source is W51 d2.

\kms with continuum subtraction using the 30th percentile emission

ALMAmm14 is one of the brightest sources outside of e2/e8/IRS2, but
it is substantially fainter than those regions.  Still, it has a noticeably
rich chemistry.

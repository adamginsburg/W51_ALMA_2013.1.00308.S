\title{Cores and Outflows in the W51 Protoclusters}
"A multi-phase outflow from a high-mass protostar"


\section{Observations}
As part of ALMA Cycle 2 program 2013.1.00308.S, we observed a
$\sim2\arcmin\times1\arcmin$ region centered between W51 IRS2 and W51 e1/e2
with a 37-pointing mosaic.  Two configurations of the 12m array were used,
achieving a resolution of 0.2\arcsec.  Additionally, a 12-pointing mosaic was
performed using the 7m array, probing scales up to XXX\arcsec.  The full UV
coverage was from XX to YY m.

Data reduction was performed using CASA.  The QA2-produced data products were
combined using the standard inverse variance weighting (check this).
The visibilities were imaged into full spectral cubes at coarse (0.5\arcsec)
resolution in order to get a first look at all 15630 spectral channels.  The
resulting cube was used to identify bright lines in the spectrum extracted
from source e8.  To produce continuum images, frequency channels including
bright lines were excluded.

The spectral setups were ...

A continuum image combining all 4 spectral windows was produced using
\texttt{tclean}.  We phase self-calibrated the image on baselines longer than
100m to increase the dynamic range.  The final image was cleaned with 50000
iterations to a threshold of 5 mJy.  The lowest noise level in the image, away
from bright sources, is $\sim0.2$ mJy/beam, but near the bright sources e2 and
IRS2, the noise reached as high as $\sim2$ mJy/beam.  Deeper cleaning was
attempted, but lead to instabilities.

\subsection{Morphological Analysis}
\label{sec:morphology}
The largest detected structures include the W51 Main HII region bubble and the
W51 IRS2 HII region, which are relatively uninteresting since their properties
have been previously well-characterized using radio (JVLA) data.  More exciting
are the bright dusty structures, especially the ``tail'' pointing south of W51
e8, which can be described as a 0.25 pc by 0.05 pc filament. This structure has
a very high surface brightness, exceeding 40 mJy/beam in our TE maps (23 K or
3.7\ee{4} MJy sr$^{-1}$)

\subsection{Simulations}
The enhanced noise around bright sources is unavoidable.  We tested the noise
properties of our data set using the CASA \texttt{simobserve} toolkit.  We
obtained a Herschel Gould's Belt Survey image of the Perseus molecular cloud at
250 \um \citep[resolution 18\arcsec][]{} and scaled it down by $\sim40\times$
to match the resolution of our ALMA data.  We used the \texttt{sm.predict} task
to ``observe'' the Herschel data with our exact UV data set.  We then used
\texttt{sm.corrupt} to make the noise properties approximately match those of
our observations.

We used the Perseus data scaled from 250 \um to 1.3 mm assuming
a relatively shallow $\beta=1.5$ and a constant temperature $T=20$ K
(since temperature maps are not available).
For the Aquila data, we used the column density and temperature maps to
derive a synthetic 1.3 mm map assuming an opacity $\kappa_{505 \mathrm{GHz}} =
4$ g \percc.  Since Aquila is at a greater distance, the Herschel resolution is
coarser (0.9 \arcsec at 5.4 kpc) than our best resolution of 0.2\arcsec, so it
is best compared to lower-resolution tapered data.


When imaging the Perseus data set, we put NGC 1333 at the image center.  At the
noise levels in our data, only the central portions of NGC 1333 are detected,
with three point sources recovered.  In this map, the noise properties are
very uniform.  We are therefore unable to analyze the NGC
1333 data with the exact same parameters as were used on W51.  However, using
similar parameters (but with a lower significance threshold), we detect only
three sources.

In a second experiment, we scaled the peak flux density of the Perseus map to
be $\sim100\times$ brighter than it should be, making it comparable to the flux
density of W51e2 in the real ALMA observations.  In this map, even with deep
cleaning, the noise around the bright sources remains very high and artifacts
are evident.



\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Source Identification}
% dendrogramming.py
We used the \texttt{dendrogram} method described by \citet{Rosolowsky2008a} and
implemented in \texttt{astrodendro} to identify sources.  We used a minimum
value of 1 mJy/beam ($\sim5-\sigma$) and a minimum $\Delta=0.4$ mJy/beam
($\sim2-\sigma$) with minimum 10 pixels (each pixel is 0.05\arcsec).  This
cataloging yielded over 8000 candidate sources, of which the majority are noise
or artifacts around the brightest sources.  To filter out these bad sources,
we created a noise map taking the local RMS of the \texttt{tclean}-produced
residual map over a $\sigma=30$ pixel (1.5\arcsec) gaussian.  We then removed
all sources with peak S/N < 8, mean S/N per pixel $< 5$, and minimum S/N per
pixel $ < 1$.  We also only included the smallest sources in the dendrogram,
the ``leaves''.  These parameters were tuned by checking against ``real''
sources identified by eye and selected using \texttt{ds9}: most real sources are
recovered (but not all; see Section ...) and few spurious sources ($<10$) are
included.  The resulting catalog includes 113 sources.

\subsection{Photometry}
We created a catalog of the dendrogram sources including their peak and mean
flux density, their centroid, and their geometric properties.  For each source,
we further extracted aperture photometry around the centroid in 6 apertures:
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5\arcsec.  We performed the same aperture
photometry on the W51 Ku-band images from \citet{Ginsburg2016a}.  These
observations are reported in Table {...}.

The source flux density distribution is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fluxhistograms}.  The most common nearest-neighbor separation between
cataloged cores is $\sim0.3\arcsec$, which implies that the larger apertures
double-count some pixels.  The smallest separation is
0.26\arcsec, so the 0.2\arcsec aperture contains only unique pixels.

on the dendrogram-extracted core centroids.  The aperture size is listed 
in the y-axis label.  Free-free-dominated sources are excluded.}

{1}{10cm}

\subsubsection{Distribution Functions}
We fit power law distributions to each aperture's flux distribution.  The
powerlaws steepen slightly from $\alpha=2.0\pm0.12$ to $\alpha=2.2\pm0.16$ for
larger apertures.  The minimum flux represented by a power law increases from
$\sim20$ mJy to 0.4 Jy (14-280 \msun at 20K).  These slopes are shallower than 
the Salpeter-like slope for the mass function derived by \citep{Konyves2015a}
for their sample, though with only modest significance ($<3-\sigma$).  Of
course, these measurements are of the continuum flux density, not directly of
the mass, and so a direct comparison may not be appropriate.  We revisit this
question after assessing the dust temperature in Section \ref{sec:massfunc}.

\subsection{Spectral Lines \& Velocities}
To determine the line-of-sight velocity of each source, we extracted a spectrum
from an 0.5\arcsec aperture centered on the source and from a 0.5-1.0\arcsec
annulus around it.  We then searched each spectrum for the brightest pixel and
associated it with the likeliest spectral line.  We repeated this in each of
our 4 spectral windows, then averaged the 4 velocities to get an estimate of
the source velocity.   This process also allowed us to identify the brightest
lines in each window and the brightest overall line observed, which we use
later for temperature estimation.

\subsection{Temperature Estimation}
\label{sec:temperature}
The temperature is a critical ingredient for determining the total mass of each
continuum source or region. Since we do not have any means of directly
determining the dust temperature, as the SED peak is well into the THz regime
and inaccessible with any existing instruments at the requisite resolution, we
employ alternative indicators.  Above a density $n\gtrsim10^5-10^6$ \percc,
the gas and dust become strongly collisionally coupled, meaning the gas
temperature should accurately reflect the dust temperature.  Below this density,
the two may be decoupled.

The average dust temperature, as estimated from Herschel Hi-Gal SED fits
\citep{Molinari2016a,Wang2015a}, is 38 K when including the 70 \um data or 26 K
when excluding it.  This average is obtained over a $\sim45\arcsec$ ($\sim 1$
pc) beam and therefore is likely to be strongly biased toward the hottest dust
in the HII regions and around the massive cores, which are known to have
temperatures reaching $>300$ K \citep{Goddi2016a}.  Despite these
uncertainties, this bulk measurement provides us with a reasonable range to
assume for the uncoupled, low-density dust, which (weakly) dominates the mass
(see Section \ref{sec:massbudget}).

One constraint on the dust temperature we can employ is the absolute surface
brightness.  For some regions, especially the ``filament'' and the hot cores
noted in Section \ref{sec:morphology}, the surface brightness is substantially
brighter than is possible for a beam-filling, optically thick blackbody at 20
K, providing a lower limit on the dust temperature ranging from 30 K (40
mJy/beam) to 600 K (1 Jy/beam).  Toward most of this emission, optically-thick
free-free emission can be strongly ruled out as the driving mechanism using
existing data that limits the free-free contribution to be $<50\%$ if it is
optically thick, and negligible ($<<1\%$) if it is optically thin (Ginsburg et
al, 2016; Goddi2016a).

To gain a more detailed measurement of the dust temperature in regions where it
is likely to be coupled to the gas, we use the peak brightness temperature
$T_{B,max}$ of lines along the line of sight.  If the observed molecule is in
local thermal equilibrium, as is expected if the density is high enough to be
coupled to the dust for many molecules, and it is optically thick, the
brightness temperature provides an approximate measurement of the true physical
temperature near the $\tau=1$ surface.  If any of these assumptions do not
hold, $T_{B,max}$ will set a lower limit on the true gas temperature.  Only
nonthermal maser emission would push $T_{B,max} > T_{gas}$.

One potential problem with this approach is if the gas becomes optically thick
before probing most of the dust.  Some transitions, e.g. CO and \formaldehyde, 
are likely to be affected by this issue.

{The peak line brightness vs the flux density of our target sources.  The
points are color-coded by the brightest observed line.  The dashed line shows
where the brightness temperature of the continuum matches that of the lines;
technically this means that it should be literally impossible for any point to
be below the line.  However, in this iteration of the plot, the lines are
extracted from broader apertures than the continuum, so the continuum peak
brightness is capable of being higher than the line peak brightness.  TODO:
replace this plot once spectra have been appropriately extracted from the
high-resolution spectral data cube.

\subsection{The most massive protostellar cores in W51}
In Figure \ref{fig:hmradprof}, we show the radial profiles extracted from the
three high-mass protostellar cores in W51: W51 North, W51 e2e, and W51 e8.
The plot shows the enclosed mass out to $\sim1\arcsec$ (5400 AU).  On larger
spatial scales, the enclosed mass rises more shallowly, indicating the end of the
core (though our data are capable of recovering spatial scales up to XXXXX).

All three sources show similar radial profiles, containing up to 3000 \msun
within a very compact radius of 5400 AU (0.03 pc).  However, the temperature
structure within these sources is certainly not homogeneous, and very likely a
large fraction of the total flux comes from $T\gtrsim300$ K heated material
\citep[Section \ref{sec:temperature}][]{Goddi2016a}.  If the observed dust were
all at 600 K, the mass would be $\sim17\times$ lower, 100 \msun, which we treat
as a strict lower bound as it is unlikely that the dust more than $\gtrsim1000$
au is so warm.  Additionally, it is very likely that a substantial mass of cold
dust is also present but undetectable because it is hidden by the hotter dust.

\Figure{figures/cumulative_radial_flux_massivecores.png}
{The cumulative flux density radial profiles centered on three
massive protostellar cores.  They share similar profiles and
are likely dominated by hot dust in their innermost regions,
but they are more likely to be dominated by cooler dust in their
outer, more massive regions.}

\subsection{The most massive prestellar cores in W51}
% may be repeated from temperature section above
To place limits on the most massive prestellar cores, we need to know the
temperature of the dust in all of the bright ($>15$ mJy; 10 \msun at 20 K)
sources.  We do not have any direct means of evaluating the dust temperature,
but we can infer at
least a lower limit on it by determining the peak brightness temperature of an
optically thick line that is excited at densities $n\gtrsim10^5$ \percc, at
which the dust and gas are coupled.

To accomplish this, we have found the brightest lines across the full $\sim6
GHz$ spectra and measured their peak brightness temperature.


\subsection{The mass budget on different spatial scales}
\ref{sec:massbudget}
An important evolutionary indicator is the amount of mass at a given density; a
more evolved (more efficiently star-forming) region will have more mass at high
densities.  We cannot measure the dense gas fraction directly, but the amount of
flux density recovered by an interferometer provides a reasonable approximation.

% total_mass_analysis
For the ``total'' flux density in the region, we use the Bolocam Galactic Plane
Survey observations \citep{Aguirre2011a,Ginsburg2013a}, which are the closest
in frequency single-dish millimeter data available.  We assume a spectral index
$\alpha=3.5$ to convert the BGPS flux density measurements at 271.4 GHz to the
mean ALMA frequency of 226.6 GHz.  The ALMA data have a total flux 23.2 Jy above
a very conservative threshold of 10 mJy/beam in our
mosaic; in the same area the BGPS data have a flux of 144 Jy, which scales down to
76.5 Jy.  The recovery fraction is 30$\pm3$\%, where the error bar accounts
for a change in $\alpha\pm0.5$.  The threshold of 10 mJy/beam corresponds to
a column threshold $N>10^{25}$ \percc for 20 K dust.  For an unresolved spherical source,
this corresponds to a volume density $n>10^{8.1}$ \percc.
